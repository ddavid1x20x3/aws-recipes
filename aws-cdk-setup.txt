# AWS CDK

# CDK allows you to describe your infrastructure using constructs in a 
# high-level programming language such as Python, which then gets 
# compiled into CloudFormation templates for you.

# To use CDK, Node.js has to be installed first. Check or verify Node.js 
# is installed:
node -v 

# Install CDK as a global package:
npm install -g aws-cdk

# Verify CDK has been installed:
cdk version

# To initiate an CDK Python project, change into the project directory
# and run:
cdk init app --language python

# To activate the Python virtual environment that the CDK has created
# for you, run the following command:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

# After activating the virtual environment, install the packages 
# required by the project. You can do this by running the following:
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
